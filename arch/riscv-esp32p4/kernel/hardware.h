    Desc: ESP32-P4 register blocks used by kernel.resource.

    Addresses are those of ESP-IDF's components/soc/esp32p4; the ones
    named here are identical in the hw_ver1 and hw_ver3 register trees.
    Kept private to the kernel until a second subsystem needs them, at
    which point they move to an exported include.
